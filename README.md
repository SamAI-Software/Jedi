Firstly, make sure to check my [interactive CV](http://bit.ly/Jedi_CP) (this.codepen) and also watch my [short video CV](https://youtu.be/8BnO1urXgTY), because it has lots of info about my projects, skills and experience.

#### // ------ CODING PROJECTS ------ //

##### // ---------- 2016 New Coder Survey --------- //

[**Website**](http://samai-software.github.io/2016-new-coder-survey/) / [**Source code**](https://github.com/SamAI-Software/2016-new-coder-survey/tree/gh-pages) (HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, D3.js, R)

For a few months I've been working on this [open source project](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey). 15K+ people responded all over the world, granting researchers an unprecedented glimpse into how adults are learning to code.

My roles:
- help to clean database (**R**) [Issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/33#issuecomment-220252460) / [PR comments](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/pull/29#discussion_r62409469)
- analyze the data (**R** & **Excel**) [List of interesting facts](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/40)
- help organize the working process (**PM**) [List of interesting visualizations](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/41)
- make bar charts and other visualizations (**D3.js**) [ScatterPlots](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/full/WwVOdV) / [BarCharts](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/pen/rLayqy) / [**PR**](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/pull/48)
- give feedback to other members (**UX**) [Issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/41#issuecomment-220540947) / [ChatRoom](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience)

##### // -------------- Personal Website -------------- //
[**Website**](http://samai-software.github.io/) / [**Source code**](https://github.com/SamAI-Software/samai-software.github.io) (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap)


I've developed my personal website from scratch (no templates) using a bit of bootstrap.

It's fully responsive, and I used the best practices - "don't set certain common break points for screens (media), instead just scale the width and fix all problems that occur".

However, it's desktop-first, because more than 95% visitors use desktop.

#### // -------- CODE PENS -------- //
##### // -------------- Bar Charts -------------- //
[**View**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/full/rLayqy) / [**Source code**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/pen/rLayqy) (HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, D3.js)

My goal was to create very clean and well-documented reusable code for bar charts as a template with different formats, that can be easily embeded into [the website](http://samai-software.github.io/2016-new-coder-survey/) and can be used in other projects.

There are three different formats and all bar charts are responsive (on page resfresh).

##### // --------------- TwitchTV --------------- //
[**View**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/full/dMwGaj) / [**Source code**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/pen/dMwGaj) (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, API, Stylus)


##### // ----------- Evil Pomodoro ----------- //
[**View**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/full/KVZoKV) / [**Source code**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/pen/KVZoKV) (HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery)

The idea was to create a very fancy and interesting UI to push my CSS skills forward.

##### // ------------ JS Calculator ------------ //
[**View**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/full/YwQLyY) / [**Source code**](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/pen/YwQLyY) (HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Back-End)

The goal was to create a calculator that won't have any bugs unlike most others and will have a similar logic to Windows Standart Calculator. For that I've made a [check-list to test calculators](https://github.com/SamAI-Software/test-ur-calc).

```diff
- Warning: it's one of my first codes, so it's very messy. But it does the job.
- Btw, try to bug it and send me a "User console", which is a part of UI.
```
